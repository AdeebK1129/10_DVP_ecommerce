Adeeb Khan, John Chandler, Jeff Chen, Tyler Chan 

In this project, a basic e-commerce website will be developed with Vue on the front end and Django and PostgreSQL on the backend (DVP stack). Additionally, Pandas and Matplotlib Python libraries will be used to generate graphs to be displayed on the UI based on data received from a public API.
