# 10_DVP_ecommerce
Adeeb Khan, John Chandler, Jeff Chen, Tyler Chan 

In this project, a basic e-commerce website will be developed with Vue on the front end and Django and PostgreSQL on the backend (DVP stack). Additionally, Pandas and Matplotlib Python libraries will be used to generate graphs to be displayed on the UI based on data received from a public API.  

***NOTE***
This project is going to be run off of python and node virtual environments that have not been added to the repository. Additionally, connections to our PostgreSQL database are made locally via a gitignored secrets.json file. To get this project to run on your own device, these modifications will have to be made.
