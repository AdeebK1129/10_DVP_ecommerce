# 10_DVP_ecommerce
In this project, a basic e-commerce website will be developed with Vue on the frontend and Django and PostgresSQL on the backend (DVP stack). Additionally, Pandas and Matplotlib python libraries will be used to generate graphs to be displayed on the UI based on data received from a public API.
